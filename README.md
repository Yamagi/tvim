# tvim

tvim is a not so simple wrapper script which runs Vim inside a *modern*
terminal, simulating the look and fell of gvim. For the best experience
it's recommended to configure Vim with modern terminal features like
`set termguicolors` and support for things like italics and colored
undercurls. Additionally it's recommended to add the Terminus plugin to
Vim: [](https://github.com/wincent/terminus)
